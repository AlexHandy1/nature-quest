# Plan Recap

Read planning and work summary documents in the current project and produce a concise session briefing.

## Step 1: Find the documents

Search for markdown files matching these patterns in the working directory and any `planning_and_status_docs/` subdirectory:

- `PLANNING*.md` — architecture and design decisions
- `WORK_SUMMARY*.md` — what was built, current state, next steps
- `EVENT_SCOUT_PLANNING*.md` or other `*PLANNING*.md` variants

Files carry a DDMMYY date marker (e.g. `WORK_SUMMARY_050626.md` = 5 June 2026). Use that marker to sort chronologically — the highest date is the most recent.

Run a find to locate all matching files:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 \( -name "PLANNING*.md" -o -name "WORK_SUMMARY*.md" \) | sort
```

## Step 2: Read the most recent files

- Read the **most recent WORK_SUMMARY** file in full — this is the primary source of current state and next steps.
- Read the **most recent PLANNING** file in full — this provides the architectural context.
- If there are older files and the most recent docs reference unresolved items, skim the previous WORK_SUMMARY for additional context.

## Step 3: Produce the recap

Output a structured briefing with these sections, kept tight (aim for under 300 words total):

### What was built
One or two sentences on the concrete deliverables from the last session.

### Current state
The state of the system right now — what works, what is broken or incomplete.

### Blockers / open questions
Any unresolved issues, broken integrations, or decisions that were deferred.

### Next steps
The prioritised list of tasks to pick up, drawn directly from the docs.

Do not pad the recap. If the docs are sparse, the recap should be sparse. Preserve the exact priorities and wording from the planning docs rather than paraphrasing into generalities.
