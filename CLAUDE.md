Start each session by running the /plan-recap skill to understand the project goal and status.

Always look for and read any ARCHITECTURE*.md files or README files across the project (including in subdirectories and modules) — make sure you review documentation and understand the codebase before you proceed.

For any new feature or project planning, run /grill-me to stress-test the plan before building. Do not run this when operating autonomously.

For any coding work:
- Always follow test driven development as outlined in /tdd and /testing.
- Look for opportunities to validate your own work and get feedback directly. Design and run an end-to-end smoke test or practical validation. For projects involving web UI use the /agent-browser skill to review UIs directly.
- Prefer the simplest change that moves things forward. Avoid large refactors or multiple concerns in one go.
- After each logical change:
	1. Check what's staged: `git status`
	2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "your message"`
	3. Commit often. Each commit should represent one coherent, working change — not a batch of unrelated edits.
- For Python projects, always use a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` if one doesn't exist, then `source venv/bin/activate` before running any `pip install`.
- Follow /documentation-and-adrs when making significant architectural decisions or choosing between competing approaches. If a README.md does not exist at the project root, create one before closing the session.

Do not write to Claude's internal memory folders (e.g. `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`). Persist session context and learnings by updating the relevant `.md` files, as explained in /documentation-and-adrs and /summarise-session.

Close each session by running the /summarise-session skill to write up what we did.

This CLAUDE.md provides the framework. Skills contain the detailed guidance. Load skills based on what you're doing:

| Skill | Purpose | Load when |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| plan-recap | Read planning docs and produce a session briefing | Start of every session |
| grill-me | Stress-test a plan by interviewing the user | New features or project planning (not autonomous runs) |
| tdd | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow, recovery strategies | Starting any code work |
| testing | Test patterns, factories, antipatterns | Starting any code work |
| agent-browser | Browser automation for reviewing web UIs | Validating web/UI changes |
| documentation-and-adrs | Record architectural decisions and ensure README exists | Significant technical decisions; end of any session where no README exists |
| summarise-session | Write a structured session summary to a WORK_SUMMARY file | End of every session |
